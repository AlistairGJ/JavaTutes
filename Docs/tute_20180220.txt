1. Inner Classes
- Embedding one class within another
- Why is it useful... (there is NO performance penalty)
a. Only call an inner class when a certain event happens ('Only need the 
class to handle a single event') - more generally, 'only the class within the 
context of the outer class'
b. We can prevent other classes accidentally using this class ('may be useful to us in a particular context, when don't want to have to think / worry about all the things other classes may ask of this class)
- 'When you make a PUBLIC class, you make it to be BULLETPROOF'
---> e.g., special checks and so on

Also - avoids pulluting your namespace
